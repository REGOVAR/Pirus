# Pirus-Server

Pirus is an application launcher service which allow user to run pipeline code from a remote REST client. Each pipeline are provided as plugin made by the community. Actually Pirus runs code in a LXC container to keep your server safe, but other technologies like Docker or Biobox, may be used (interface need to be implemented).
